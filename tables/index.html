		<!--the head will indicate a line of column headers
            the cell tag for this line will be <th>
            the contents of this line will be bolded by default
        
            optionally: one can have their head titles on the row
            here the developer uses the first collumn (general) as 
            the titles for the data
            if you re designing your table in this function then
            a head area is not needed and the first cell on your body row 
            will be a <th> cell
                
            
            the t body contains the data for the table
            each row represents a single row of table data
            think of a grid system (tabular)
            the text will not have any styling by default
            
            see above for using <th> cell if you wish for your 
            heading to appear on the row instead of the collumn

            <td> cells are grouped under a set of <tr> set of tags
            <tr> is a row
            <td> is a cell

            the tfoot area is generally for totals, special messages, comments

            data cells <td> can be merged
            a set of merged <tf> has a parameter call colspan="" where
            "" is the number of data cells to merge into one
            a table row should not have a set of merged cells greater that the
            the number of coolumns on the table 

            the Border="1" will add a default border around the table and each cell
        -->
